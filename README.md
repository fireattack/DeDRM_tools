# DeDRM tools - Mini

This is a minimized version of [DeDRM tools](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools) which removes all the unnecessary files and folders, leaving only the files needed to run standalone DRM removal scripts for Kindle.

It is meant to be used with [extract_kindle](https://github.com/fireattack/extract_kindle) project.
